Let this app look for satellites for you!

Thanks to the huge database provided by Celestrak and SatNOGS you have access to more than 3000
active satellites orbiting Earth at this very moment. You can search the entire DB by satellite
name or by NORAD catalog number. Track them with ease!

Satellite positions and passes are calculated relative to your location. In order to get reliable
predictions set the observation position using GPS or QTH Locator in the Settings menu.

The application is built using predict4java library, Kotlin, Coroutines, Dagger2, Retrofit2, Moshi,
Architecture Components and Jetpack Navigation. It is now and always will be completely ad-free
and open-source. Make sure you check the app developer's
<a href="https://github.com/rt-bishop/Look4Sat">GitHub repository</a>.
